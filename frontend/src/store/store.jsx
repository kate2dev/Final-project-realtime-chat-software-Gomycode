// * combineReducers: This function combines multiple reducers into a single root reducer. Each reducer manages a different part of the state.

// createStore: This function creates the Redux store, which holds your application's state.

// applyMiddleware: Redux middleware allows you to extend Redux with custom functionality.Here, you're using middleware to handle asynchronous actions with redux-thunk.

// redux - thunk: This is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return functions instead of plain objects.Itâ€™s useful for handling asynchronous logic, such as fetching data from an API.

/*
createStore creates the Redux store by passing in:
The rootReducer (which combines all your individual reducers).
composeWithDevTools wraps applyMiddleware(thunk) to enable the Redux DevTools extension and allow middleware (thunk) to be used.
applyMiddleware(thunk) applies the redux-thunk middleware to the store. This allows your action creators to return functions (thunks) to handle asynchronous logic (like API calls).
